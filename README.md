### Chapitre 1 : 

#### 1.1 what's a microprocessor from Jim Keller (main microprocessor ingenneer at intel-amd-apple)
 * [Jim Keller](https://youtu.be/Nb2tebYAaOA) :  
 "every 6 instructions u have to make decision : equal - lower - upper ..."  
 "the 1% inspiration is still very important"  
 "everything going into modern calculation is noisy, so why the answer would have to be so clear"  
 "what people don't understand is that u get a determinist answer even so the execusion flow is very underterministic"  
 "u run the programm 100 times, it never works the same flow but u always get the same answer !"  
 "sometimes u hit the limit - u have to restart from scratch every 3 to 5 years"  
 "if u want to do a lot of progress in computer architecture every 3 to 5 years u have to re-write one"  
 "simple rule of Gordon Moore was double the nb of transitors every 2 years - my operation model is we increase the performance of computers by 2.x every 2 or 3 years"
